# Automated ODrive setup for HoverBot
Once you installed all tools following these instructions https://docs.odriverobotics.com/#downloading-and-installing-tools these two scripts take care of setting up the ODrive for hoverbot (assuming the wiring of the motors and hall sensors is correct).

All you need to do is 
1. Wire up the ODrive and the motors
2. Power up the ODrive
3. Make sure both motors are ABSOLUTELY FREE TO TURN
4. Connect the ODrive to your computer
5. Run the first script ODrive_hoverboard_motor_setup_part_01.py
6. Run the second script ODrive_hoverboard_motor_setup_part_02.py (or run the motor specific scripts if you want to calibrate the motors separately)
